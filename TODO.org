* DONE Qt Simulator port
* DONE Harmattan port
* DONE Symbian port

  Symbian builds are not (presently) supported with qmake.
  Possible issues with compatibility with different Qt releases
  unknown. In principle they should be backwards binary compatible,
  at least. Builds tested with QT 4.7.0 and QTM 1.1.0.

* HTTP POSTing should be made to handle posting errors cleanly
* BlackBerry 10 port?
